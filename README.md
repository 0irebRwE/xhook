# XHook

> Easily intercept and modify XHR request and response

With XHook, you could easily implement functionality to:
* Cache requests in memory
* Insert authentication headers
* Simulate responses
  * For testing purposes, just add your test hooks and your code can remain the same
* Sending Error statistics to Google Analytics
* Polyfil CORS, by offloading requests to an iframe then splicing the response back in, see [XDomain](http://jpillora.com/xdomain)
* Devious practical jokes

## Features

* Intercept and modify XHR value changes
* Intercept and modify XHR method calls 
* Manually trigger XHR events 

## Example

We could use XHook all requests to 'example.json' and convert all vowels to **z**'s like:

``` javascript
xhook(function(xhr) {
  xhr.on('set:responseText', function(curr, prev) {
    if(xhr.url.match(/example\.json$/))
      return curr.replace(/[aeiou]/g,'z');
  });
});
```

* Development [xhook.js](http://jpillora.com/xhook/dist/xhook.js) 8.9KB
* Production [xhook.min.js](http://jpillora.com/xhook/dist/xhook.min.js) 3.6KB (0.9KB Gzip)

* Note: It's **important** to include XHook first as other libraries may
  store a reference to `XMLHttpRequest` before XHook can patch it*

## API

### xhook(`callback(xhr)`)

Adds a hook

`callback` will be called with an xhook `xhr` instance

### `xhr`.`set`(`propertyName`, `value`)

Sets a property to a new value, which the underlying XHR cannot modify

*Note, when setting `readyState`: This will `xhr.trigger()` all of the remaining *unfired* events (`readystatechange`,`onload`,etc.). So make you `xhr.set()`/`setResponseHeader()` the appropriate values (`responseText`, `status`,etc.)
prior to setting `readyState`.*

*Will not fire the `onChange()` handler*

### `xhr`.`setRequestHeader`(`key`, `value`)

Sets a request header, which the underlying XHR cannot modify

### `xhr`.`setResponseHeader`(`key`, `value`)

Sets a response header, which the underlying XHR cannot modify

### `xhr`.`onChange`(`propertyName`, `callback(curr, prev)`)

Intercept a property change

`curr` is the current, `prev` is the previous values of that property,
to use a value other than `curr`, simply return different value.

### `xhr`.`onCall`(`methodName`, `callback(args)`)

Intercept a method call

`args` is a modifiable array of arguments

If you return `undefined` (or equivalently not returning or return nothing), `args`
will be used. If you return a new array, it will be used. If you
return `false` the method call will be cancelled.

> Tip: `"open"` has `args` `[method, url]`

### `xhr`.`trigger`(`event`, `obj` = {})

Manually trigger XHR events passing the handler `obj`. (Will set `obj.type = event`.)

### Issues

* `xhr instanceof XMLHttpRequest` checks will return `false`

* XHook does **not** attempt to resolve any browser compatibility issues. Libraries like jQuery 
and https://github.com/ilinsky/xmlhttprequest will attempt to do this. XHook simply proxies and
modifies calls to and from XMLHttpRequest (and ActiveXObject), so you may use any library
conjunction with XHook, just make sure to load XHook **first**.
