**Attention: XHook has been rewritten to simplify the API**

<!--
[![browser support](https://ci.testling.com/jpillora/xhook.png)](https://ci.testling.com/jpillora/xhook)
-->

With XHook, you could easily implement functionality to:

* Cache requests in memory, localStorage, etc.
* Insert authentication headers
  * S3 Request Signing
* Simulate responses
  * For testing purposes, just add your test hooks and your code can remain the same
* Sending Error statistics to Google Analytics
* Polyfil CORS, by offloading requests to an iframe then splicing the response back in, see [XDomain](http://jpillora.com/xdomain)
* Devious practical jokes
* Preflight GZip compression, see [XZip](http://github.com/jpillora/xzip) (In progress)

## Features

* Intercept and modify XHR **request** and **response**
* Simulate **responses** transparently
* Backwards compatible `addEventListener` `removeEventListener`

## Future Features

* Backwards compatible user controlled progress (download/upload) events

## Example

Here, we're converting vowels to **z**'s in all requests to 'example.txt':

``` javascript
//modify 'responseText' of 'example2.txt'
xhook.after(function(request, response) {
  if(request.url.match(/example\.txt$/)) 
    response.text = response.text.replace(/[aeiou]/g,'z');
});
```

## Browser Support

Tested in IE8+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## Live Demos

See the above example and more here:

## Download

* Development [xhook.js](http://jpillora.com/xhook/dist/1/xhook.js) 7.8KB
* Production [xhook.min.js](http://jpillora.com/xhook/dist/1/xhook.min.js) 3.3KB (0.8KB Gzip)

  *Note: It's **important** to include XHook first as other libraries may store a reference to `XMLHttpRequest` before XHook can patch it*

## API

### `xhook`.`before`(`handler(request[, callback])`)

We can **modify** the `request` before the XHR is sent.

If our `handler` is asynchronous, just include the `callback` argument, which accepts an optional `response` object.

To provide a **fake** response, simply `return` or `callback()` a `response` object.

### `xhook`.`after`(`handler(request, response[, callback])`)

We can **read** the `request` and **modify** the `response` before the XHR is recieved.

If our `handler` is asynchronous, just include the `callback` argument.

### `request` Object

* `method` (String)
* `url` (String)
* `body` (String) **May implement binary data in the future**
* `headers` (Object)
* `timeout` (Number)

### `response` Object

* `status` (Number) **Required when for fake `response`s**
* `statusText` (String)
* `text` (String) *(XMLHttpRequest `responseText`)*
* `headers` (Object)
* `type` (String) *(XMLHttpRequest `responseType`)*
* `xml` (XML) *(XMLHttpRequest `responseXML`)*
* `data` (Varies) *(XMLHttpRequest `response`)*

### Overview

*The dark red `before` hook is returning a `response` object, which will trigger the `after`
hooks, then trigger the appropriate events, so it **appears** as if `response` came from 
the server.*

### Reference

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest

### Issues

* `xhr instanceof XMLHttpRequest` checks will return `false`

* XHook does **not** attempt to resolve any browser compatibility issues. Libraries like jQuery 
and https://github.com/ilinsky/xmlhttprequest will attempt to do this. XHook simply proxies to and from `XMLHttpRequest` and `ActiveXObject`, so you may use any library
conjunction with XHook, just make sure to load XHook **first**.
