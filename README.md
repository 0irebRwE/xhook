# XHook

> Hook (monkey-patch) XHR to easily modify requests and responses

With XHook, you could easily implement functionality to:
* Cache requests in memory
* Insert authentication headers
* Simulate responses
  * For testing purposes, just add your test hooks and everything else stays the same
  * For cross-domain requests, offload requests to an iframe then simulate a successful response, see [XDomain](http://jpillora.com/xhook)
* Error tracking to Google Analytics


## Examples

**[Modify response text of requests to 'example2.json'](http://jpillora.com/xhook#jquery)**

``` javascript
xhook(function(xhr) {
  xhr.on('set:responseText', function(curr, prev) {
    if(xhr.url.match(/example2\.json$/))
      return curr.replace(/[aeiou]/g,'z');
  });
});
```

## Download

* Development [xhook.js](http://jpillora.com/xhook/dist/xhook.js) 7.5KB
* Production [xhook.min.js](http://jpillora.com/xhook/dist/xhook.min.js) 3.1KB (0.7KB Gzip)

* Note: It's **important** to include XHook first as other libraries may
  store a reference to `XMLHttpRequest` before XHook can patch it*

## API

### xhook(`callback(xhr)`)

Adds a hook

`callback` will be called with an xhook `xhr` instance

### `xhr`.`set`(`propertyName`, `value`)

Sets a property to a new value, which the underlying XHR cannot modify

*Note, when setting `readyState`: This will `xhr.trigger()` all of the remaining *unfired* events (`readystatechange`,`onload`,etc.). So make you `xhr.set()`/`setResponseHeader()` the appropriate values (`responseText`, `status`,etc.)
prior to setting `readyState`.*

*Will not fire the `onChange()` handler*

### `xhr`.`setRequestHeader`(`key`, `value`)

Sets a request header, which the underlying XHR cannot modify

### `xhr`.`setResponseHeader`(`key`, `value`)

Sets a response header, which the underlying XHR cannot modify

### `xhr`.`onChange`(`propertyName`, `callback(curr, prev)`)

Intercept a property change

`curr` is the current, `prev` is the previous values of that property,
to use a value other than `curr`, simply return different value.

### `xhr`.`onCall`(`methodName`, `callback(args)`)

Intercept a method call

`args` is a modifiable array of arguments

If you return `undefined` (or equivalently return nothing), `args`
will be used. If you return a new array, it will be used. If you
return `false` the method call will be cancelled.

> Tip: `"open"` has args `[method, url]`

### `xhr`.`trigger`(`event`, `obj` = {})

Manually trigger XHR events

Will set `obj.type = event`

### Issues

* `xhr instanceof XMLHttpRequest` checks will return `false`

* XHook does **not** attempt to resolve any browser compatibility issues. Libraries like jQuery 
and https://github.com/ilinsky/xmlhttprequest will attempt to do this. XHook simply proxies and
modifies calls to and from XMLHttpRequest (and ActiveXObject), so you may use any library
conjunction with XHook, just make sure to load XHook **first**.
